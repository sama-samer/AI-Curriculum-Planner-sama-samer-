 How to Run the Project
Download or clone the repo into a local folder.

Make sure main.ipynb, curriculum.py, and students.py are in the same directory.

Open and run main.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

The notebook will:

Build a graph-based curriculum

Simulate 100 students (with GPA, interests, grades)

Generate personalized course recommendations using:

ðŸ”¹ Heuristic method (interest + eligibility + load)

ðŸ”¹ Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning)

Outputs:

 simulated_student_data.csv â†’ contains all student profiles

 curriculum_graph_visualization.png â†’ visual map of courses

 Printed recommendations for first 10 students

 How the RL Works
States = Courses completed so far

Actions = Courses the student is eligible to take

Rewards = Simulated GPA + bonus for aligned interests

Goal = Learn which course sequences lead to higher GPA and graduation
